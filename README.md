A medium.com hack to read free with auto incognito in Google Chrome.

For a lot people, medium is a daily go to place for reading articles. And a lot of articles are paid or under their partner program. They offer free users to read only 3 paid articles a month. And sometimes we loose that valuable slot by just misclicking.

One trick is there to read more paid articles, is to open those via incognito. That's a painful task everytime. So, I decided to make a little hack via a chrome extension which will do that for me. I just click on any article as usual, the extension then decides if the article should be opened in incognito mode or normal mode.

Isn't that amazing !!!

### How to use
1. Download and extract the project on your computer => https://github.com/nowshad-sust/freedium/archive/master.zip
2. Open your chrome browser and browse to: chrome://extensions/
3. Enable your developer mode switch from the top right corder of your browser.
4. Click on `Load unpacked` button.
5. Select the folder you've just extracted.
6. You're all set :)

### WARNING
If you have the ability to buy or get the paid memebership, then please avoid this extension. People invest their valuable time writing those articles, we should value them if we can.
